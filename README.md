# console-automation-mcp-legacy

This repository preserves the RunBeacon 2.0.x interactive console, 40-tool MCP surface, and legacy protocol integrations. It is a maintenance-only compatibility line: only High/Critical security fixes are accepted for six months after RunBeacon 3.0 reaches Stable.

New lifecycle, SSH Runner, dashboard, credential, and GitHub publishing development belongs in [RunBeacon](https://github.com/Liyuchen0118/RunBeacon). New installations should use `console-automation-mcp@3`; use this package only when migration is temporarily blocked by a removed console or protocol API.

No `remote-job-monitor` Codex plugin is shipped from this repository, so installing the legacy npm package cannot replace the RunBeacon 3.0 plugin.

## Legacy 2.0 behavior

RunBeacon turns long-running local and SSH commands into tracked jobs for Codex. The Codex plugin keeps the stable ID `remote-job-monitor`: Codex starts a job once, calls `job_wait` once, and resumes when the resident daemon reports a terminal event. A live MCP Apps dashboard refreshes by calling the MCP server directly, so dashboard updates and intermediate status checks do not create model turns.

For non-interactive remote execution, RunBeacon is the default route. Its skill description makes Codex prefer `job_start` for server/SSH requests, a `UserPromptSubmit` Hook adds the routing policy and records a short-lived prompt trace, and a `PreToolUse` Hook attaches that trace to `job_start` without relying on the model to copy fields. A second `PreToolUse` policy blocks raw `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`, or `plink` commands that would bypass lifecycle tracking. Plugin Hooks must be reviewed and trusted by the user after installation.

Plugin version 1.0.0 and npm version 2.0.0 add security-bounded RE2 progress parsing, shared `job_wait` coordination, entry-point log redaction, verified TLS-only VNC challenge authentication, and strict HTTPS Xen XAPI access. This is a breaking security release; see the [2.0 security migration guide](docs/SECURITY_MIGRATION_2.0.md).

## What is implemented

- Resident cross-platform daemon over a local named pipe or Unix socket
- Event-driven `job_wait` with a configurable 24-hour MCP tool timeout, one timer per job, and bounded per-job/global waiters
- Local process and SSH channel ownership, output capture, cancellation, and timeout handling
- Lifecycle assessment with active/stalled state, elapsed time, progress, and linear ETA
- MCP Apps dashboard whose refresh loop consumes no model tokens
- Direct default-SSH launcher in the dashboard, bypassing model scheduling for exact commands
- End-to-end prompt, credential, queue, SSH, command, and total latency breakdowns
- Dashboard-tracked Git commit, push, and GitHub Actions phases through `github_publish_start`
- Retry-bounded GitHub API monitoring with proxy reuse, workflow eligibility detection, and distinct push/monitoring outcomes
- `PreToolUse` Hook that blocks untracked raw `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`, and `plink`
- `UserPromptSubmit` Hook that selects RunBeacon for operational remote-server requests
- Turn-scoped `PreToolUse` trace injection for reliable prompt-to-tool timing and retry deduplication
- Memory-only inline SSH passwords/passphrases and pinned host-key support
- `credential_profile_*` tools for SSH agent/private-key references and safe OS-managed credential references
- `ssh_password_save` and `ssh_password_delete` for IP/host, username, and OS-managed SSH password profiles
- `github_token_save` and `github_token_delete` for OS-managed GitHub PAT credentials
- Independent default SSH and GitHub profiles with explicit set/clear tools
- Persistent redacted job metadata; command output persistence is off by default
- Reattachment from a new MCP client to jobs owned by the resident daemon
- Protocol v4 monotonic daemon upgrades; an older Codex task cannot downgrade a newer resident build
- Prompt-trace idempotency that binds one remote execution request to one job
- RE2-compatible progress patterns compiled once per job and matched against a bounded 16 KiB line tail
- Pre-sink structured log redaction with depth, key, array, and string limits

## Token-free control flow

  participant C as Codex model
  participant M as MCP shim

  M->>D: snapshots

  M-->>C: tool result; continue next step
```

The dashboard still refreshes locally every 1.5 seconds, but those calls run between the MCP App and the MCP server. Each dashboard is bound to the job that opened it and refreshes only that `jobId` through `job_snapshot`; it never loads historical jobs. These calls do not invoke the model and do not spend model tokens. The model-facing path is event-driven.

For latency-sensitive exact commands, open the dashboard and use **Run on default SSH**. The app calls `job_start` directly, preserves shell text verbatim, disables duplicate clicks, and reuses the same request trace if a tool response is lost. This removes prompt-to-tool model scheduling from the critical path. Each job card separates `prompt→tool`, credential lookup, queue, SSH handshake, command runtime, and total time so a slow model turn cannot be mistaken for slow remote execution.

The `UserPromptSubmit` Hook records a UUID and timestamp for natural-language remote requests. A matching `PreToolUse` Hook injects them into `job_start` for the same Codex session and turn, so timing no longer depends on the model copying optional arguments. The short-lived state contains only hashed session/turn keys and timing fields, never prompts, commands, or credentials. The lifecycle manager returns the existing job when the same trace is submitted again, even if a retry changes the command or idempotency key. A changed command requires a new user request instead of an automatic second execution.

SSH handshakes use a 12-second per-attempt ready timeout and retry pre-ready failures up to five times with a 250ms bounded exponential backoff. Override these conservative defaults with `RJM_SSH_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` (1,000-30,000), `RJM_SSH_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS` (0-30,000), or `RJM_SSH_HANDSHAKE_ATTEMPTS` (1-5). RunBeacon never retries after SSH becomes ready because the command may already have reached the host.

## GitHub publishing dashboard

Call `github_publish_start` with a repository directory. If `commitMessage` is supplied, RunBeacon commits only changes that are already staged, then performs a normal non-force push. It never runs `git add`, so file selection remains an explicit user or Codex action.

```json
{
  "cwd": "C:\\work\\my-repository",
  "remote": "origin",
  "commitMessage": "feat: add dashboard",
  "watchActions": true,
  "requireActions": false,
  "idempotencyKey": "publish-dashboard-v1"
}
```

The attached MCP App shows `preflight`, `commit`, `push`, `pushed`, `actions-discovery`, `actions`, and terminal phases. Before polling, RunBeacon parses local workflow YAML and checks open pull requests. A feature-branch push with no eligible push or pull-request workflow finishes quickly as `no-workflows` instead of waiting for a run that cannot exist. Draft pull requests are included.

GitHub API calls use a 15-second per-attempt timeout, at most five retry attempts within the caller deadline, exponential backoff with jitter, and `Retry-After` for HTTP 429. Network failures plus HTTP 408, 429, and 5xx are retried; authentication and permission responses are not blindly repeated. Proxy precedence is `RUNBEACON_GITHUB_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, Git URL-specific proxy, `git http.proxy`, then direct. `NO_PROXY` is respected, and proxy credentials are never emitted.

Push and monitoring results are separate. A push failure or an actual failing Actions conclusion fails the job. After a confirmed push, unavailable API monitoring ends as `monitoring-degraded` by default, while no eligible workflow ends as `no-workflows`; both remain successful publish jobs. Set `requireActions: true` when missing or unavailable Actions monitoring must fail a release gate.

For a public repository, Actions discovery works anonymously at a rate-limit-safe interval. A private repository can use the memory-only `githubToken` argument; the token is passed only to the runner environment and is never added to the command, job metadata, output, or persistent state.

Use `job_wait` once with the returned job ID when Codex should automatically continue to the next reasoning step after publishing. Merely watching the dashboard requires no model turns.

## Saved SSH credential profiles

RunBeacon profiles store connection references, never secrets. Create an SSH profile with `credential_profile_save` using a host, username, pinned host-key fingerprint, and either `agent: "auto"` or `privateKeyPath`. Then pass only `credentialProfile` to `job_start`; when a target contains a matching host and user but no inline authentication, RunBeacon also selects the unique matching SSH profile automatically.

```json
{
  "id": "production",
  "kind": "ssh",
  "host": "server.example.com",
  "username": "deploy",
  "agent": "auto",
  "hostKeySha256": "SHA256:..."
}
```

After the key is loaded into the OS `ssh-agent`, a tracked command needs only `command` and `credentialProfile: "production"`.

When password authentication is required, call `ssh_password_save`. Prefer `passwordEnvVar`; use the memory-only `password` field only when the user deliberately supplies the password in the conversation:

```json
{
  "id": "training-server",
  "host": "192.0.2.10",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "trainer",
  "passwordEnvVar": "RUNBEACON_SSH_PASSWORD",
  "hostKeySha256": "SHA256:...",
  "makeDefault": true
}
```

RunBeacon sends the password to the configured Git credential helper over stdin and verifies it through a non-interactive read. The profile JSON stores only the IP/host, port, username, host-key policy, and `credentialKind: "password"`; `job_start` reads the password into memory only for the SSH connection. It is excluded from command arguments, environment metadata, job records, errors, logs, and dashboard responses. RunBeacon rejects the plaintext Git `credential-store` helper; configure Git Credential Manager or another OS-backed helper.

For GitHub OAuth, sign in once through Git Credential Manager:

```powershell
git credential-manager github login --device --no-ui
```

Save `{ "id": "github-main", "kind": "github", "host": "github.com" }` and pass `credentialProfile: "github-main"` to `github_publish_start`. Git itself obtains the push credential, and the background Actions watcher calls `git credential fill` with interaction disabled. Credential-helper output is kept in runner memory, never forwarded to logs or the model, and never written to job state. The profile does not perform the initial OS login; `ssh-add` or Git Credential Manager login is a one-time user action.

To import a GitHub PAT, prefer an environment variable that is already available to the MCP server:

```json
{
  "id": "github-pat",
  "username": "octocat",
  "tokenEnvVar": "RUNBEACON_GITHUB_PAT"
}
```

Call `github_token_save` with that input. When the user explicitly chooses to paste a PAT into the conversation, the tool also accepts `token` instead of `tokenEnvVar`. In both modes the PAT travels to `git credential approve` over stdin, is verified through a non-interactive `git credential fill`, and is never placed in command arguments or RunBeacon persistence. Conversation history may retain a pasted token, so environment import or Git Credential Manager's login flow is safer.

RunBeacon refuses the plaintext Git `credential-store` helper for PAT and SSH-password saving. Configure Git Credential Manager or another OS-backed helper first.

Use the resulting `credentialProfile: "github-pat"` with `github_publish_start`. `github_token_delete` removes both a PAT profile and its matching helper credential; it refuses to delete generic OAuth/login profiles.

`credential_profile_list` returns only safe references. `credential_profile_delete` removes the RunBeacon reference but does not delete OS credentials, agent keys, or key files. Use `ssh_password_delete` when both an SSH password profile and its matching OS-managed credential must be removed.

## Default credential profiles

Call `credential_profile_set_default` with an existing profile id, or pass `makeDefault: true` while saving a profile. RunBeacon keeps one SSH default and one GitHub default. `credential_profile_list` marks each selected profile with `isDefault` and returns the current `defaults` map.

For a remote SSH request with no named server, `job_start` uses the SSH default only when `useDefaultCredential: true` is explicitly present. Local jobs never inherit it. Explicit `credentialProfile`, host, or inline authentication remains authoritative. For `github_publish_start`, the GitHub default is automatic when both `credentialProfile` and `githubToken` are absent.

Use `credential_profile_clear_default` to stop automatic selection without deleting the profile. Deleting a profile also clears it if it was the default.

## Development quick start

```powershell
npm ci --ignore-scripts --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
npm run build
npx jest src/tests/LifecycleManager.test.ts --runInBand --coverage=false
npm run test:lifecycle:mcp
npm run test:lifecycle:daemon
npm run test:github-publish
```

The plugin entry point is `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; its bundled MCP server is declared in `.mcp.json`, its routing policy is in `hooks/hooks.json`, and its workflow guidance is in `skills/monitor-remote-jobs/SKILL.md`.

See [RunBeacon architecture](docs/REMOTE_JOB_MONITOR_ARCHITECTURE.md) for lifecycle states, security boundaries, extension points, and the remaining production-hardening work.

## Important boundary

The plugin can reliably monitor only commands that it launches through `job_start` or `github_publish_start`. A Hook can stop raw SSH before it starts, but no plugin can reconstruct a complete process lifecycle after an arbitrary command has already detached outside the plugin. Inline SSH passwords supplied to `job_start` remain single-job and memory-only. Passwords intentionally saved through `ssh_password_save` persist only in the OS credential manager and are read into memory for the selected job; SSH agent or key-path authentication remains preferred.

## Quick Installation

### Windows

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ooples/mcp-console-automation.git
cd mcp-console-automation
.\install.ps1 -Target codex
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ooples/mcp-console-automation.git
cd mcp-console-automation
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh --target codex
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ooples/mcp-console-automation.git
cd mcp-console-automation
npm ci
npm run build
codex mcp add console-automation --env LOG_LEVEL=warn -- node "$PWD/dist/mcp/server.js"
```

## Configuration

Codex stores MCP configuration in `~/.codex/config.toml`. The installers use `codex mcp add` and safely replace an existing `console-automation` registration. Restart Codex after installation and use `/mcp` to verify the connection.

For another MCP client, generate a new JSON configuration without overwriting an existing file:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Target custom -CustomPath C:\path\to\new-mcp-config.json
```

The npm package has not been published, so `npx console-automation-mcp` and `@mcp/console-automation` are not valid installation paths.

### Saved SSH credentials

`console_save_profile` rejects inline passwords, private-key material, and passphrases. Use `passwordEnvVar`, `privateKeyEnvVar` or `privateKeyPath`, and `passphraseEnvVar`. Profile-list responses never return credential values, and configuration files are created with owner-only permissions where the operating system supports POSIX modes.

### Session persistence

Session persistence is disabled by default because session recovery data can include commands, paths, and environment values. To opt in, set `MCP_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=true`. The default file is `~/.console-automation-mcp/sessions.json`; override it with `MCP_SESSION_PERSISTENCE_PATH`. Persisted command/environment recovery data remains disabled unless enabled through the programmatic `SessionManager` configuration.

The production installers remove development and optional protocol packages. Local consoles and SSH remain available. Install only the peer packages required for Docker, cloud, Kubernetes, serial, or other optional adapters.

## Error Detection Patterns

The server includes built-in patterns for detecting common error types:

- Generic errors (error:, ERROR:, Error:)
- Exceptions (Exception:, exception)
- Warnings (Warning:, WARNING:)
- Fatal errors
- Failed operations
- Permission/access denied
- Timeouts
- Stack traces (Python, Java, Node.js)
- Compilation errors
- Syntax errors
- Memory errors
- Connection errors

## Development

### Building from source

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Running in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Type checking

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

The server is built with:

- **Node child processes and ssh2**: For local command execution and SSH sessions
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk**: MCP protocol implementation
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Winston**: For structured logging

### Core Components

1. **ConsoleManager**: Manages terminal sessions, input/output, and lifecycle
2. **ErrorDetector**: Analyzes output for errors and exceptions
3. **MCP Server**: Exposes console functionality through MCP tools
4. **Session Management**: Handles multiple concurrent console sessions

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- Optional serial-port integrations can require platform build tools.

## Testing

Run static validation, the build, MCP smoke tests, and the test suite:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test:mcp
npm run test:logger
npm run test:installer
npm run test:package
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied errors**: Ensure the server has permission to spawn processes
2. **Optional native dependency errors**: Install platform build tools only when enabling serial-port integrations
3. **Session not responding**: Check if the command requires TTY interaction
4. **Output not captured**: Some applications may write directly to terminal, bypassing stdout
